Data Reused
================

Data reuse is the process of leveraging an existing dataset to fulfill a valuable mission with positive reward. The valuation of dataset closely depends on how well it gets reused. A dataset, regardless how hard it was produced and how easy it could be reused, will perish if it is not used by anyone. Data reuse with positive reward increases social welfare and keeps data reuse ecosystem healthy. 

There are a lot of ways to get data reused, e.g. data visualization, data sharing, data conversion, data linking, data fusion, and data cleaning.
